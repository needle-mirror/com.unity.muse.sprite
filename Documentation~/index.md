# Get started with Muse Sprite Generator

The Muse Sprite Generator is a tool that uses machine learning to generate [sprites](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Sprites.html) based on the prompt you enter. You can set the number of sprites to generate. You can also apply the generated sprites directly to objects in your **Scene** view.
## Launch the tool

1. From the menu, select **Muse** > **Muse Sprite**.
2. Resize the **Muse Generator** window until you can see all the UI.

> [!TIP]
> When possible, dock the **Muse Generator** window. This keeps you from losing the window and launching it multiple times.

## Generate sprites

1. Enter a [prompt](xref:write-prompt).
1. To set the number of sprites to generate, move the **Images** slider or enter a number in the **Images** field.
1. To remove the background from the generated sprites, enable **Remove Background**.
1. Select **Generate**. The sprites appear in the **Generations** panel.

## Apply generated sprites

To apply the generated sprite directly to your project, drag it from the **Generations** panel into your **Scene** view.
