# Manage generated sprites

You can manage the generated sprites in the **Generations** panel.

## Star

To mark a sprite as a favorite, select the **Star** icon. To remove the star, select the **Star** icon again.

## Filter

To filter the generated sprites, enter a keyword in the **Search** box. The keyword can be a full or partial match to the prompt you used to generate the sprites.

## Scale

To make the generated images bigger or smaller, move the slider at the bottom of the **Generations** panel.
