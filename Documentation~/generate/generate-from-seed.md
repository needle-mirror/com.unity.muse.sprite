# Generate from a seed

Every sprite you generate comes with a seed. A seed is a number that either you enter or is generated automatically by the tool. The seed combined with the prompt is used to identify the sprite.

To generate the same sprite, use the same seed and prompt. For example:

- A seed of `10` with the prompt of `dog` generates the same dog sprite.
- A seed of `10` with the prompt of `cat` generates the same cat sprite.

When you generate a sprite, the seed is displayed in the **Generations** panel. You can also specify a seed to generate a sprite.

To generate a sprite with a specific seed:

1. In the **Seed** field, enter a seed or click **R** to automatically generate a seed.
1. In the **Prompt** field, write a prompt that describes the sprite you want to generate.

> [!TIP]
> To generate the same sprite, use the same seed and prompt.
